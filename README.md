# spatial-econometrics
This is my final project for the Spatial Econometrics course in USC's Spatial Sciences Institute. 
The project is on law enforcement stops/outcomes and racial profiling in the City of Los Angeles.
This work was conducted as a part of a broader research project through USC's Master of Public Policy program and will only be public for a brief grading period. 
After a set period this work will be taken down to be included in a larger report which should be publish Fall 2022, utilizing probit, spatial lag and hot spot analyses to
track racial profiling and its economic effects in California.
