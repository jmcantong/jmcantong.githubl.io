# spatial-econometrics
This is my final project for the Spatial Econometrics course in USC's Spatial Sciences Institute. 
The project is on law enforcement stops/outcomes and racial profiling in the City of Los Angeles, focusing particularly on the material-economic impacts of 
policing institutions and how they are deployed in racially disparate ways across bodies and across space. This work was conducted as a part of a broader research project through USC's Master of Public Policy program. This work will be published through a larger report in Fall 2022, which will utilize probit regressions, spatial lag regressions, hot spot analyses, and semi-structured interviews to track and contextualize racial profiling in law enforcement stops and its economic effects, in California.
